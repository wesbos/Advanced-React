# ----------------------
# Define your Mutation/Query schemas here. All you're doing is an outline of
# What should happen. For example, in a Mutaiton, you define the fields
# you expect to take in, and the result of the Mutation.
# The actual implementation happens in /resolvers/Mutation

# NOTE: this is how you import in graphql files
# import * from './generated/prisma.graphql'

type Mutation {
  createItem(
    title: String
    description: String
    price: Int
    image: String
    largeImage: String
  ): Item!
}

  items: [Item]!
